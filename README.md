# ClimateEconResearch
This repository contains back-ups of my analysis and visualizations for climate data and outputs

My study examined the impact of financial development on the transition to renewable energy generation, focusing specifically on the emerging markets of the Indian subcontinent.Using World Development Indicator data (WDI) and Our World in Data (OWID)from 1990-2021. I implemented the ARDL-PMG proposed by Pesaran et al. (1999) to examine the long and short-term impact in the model. 

The scripts in this repository are all the files I've used so far to import the data, clean it, generate the necessary parameters of the model, construct simulations, and produce graphs for the same.

I have additionally committed some other pyhton-scripts that are related to this project.
